## üé® Tailwind CSS Experience

This project was my first experience using Tailwind CSS. I found it incredibly fast and efficient for styling web applications, thanks to its utility-first approach. Tailwind made it easy to:

- **Style components directly in HTML** using intuitive class names.
- **Implement responsive design** with minimal effort.
- **Toggle dark/light themes** using Tailwind‚Äôs built-in dark mode.
- **Customize and extend** styles as needed.
